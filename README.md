## Adaptive Precision Training for Multi-Modal Models Across Heterogeneous GPU Architectures

This project investigates high-performance multi-modal model training using DeepSpeed with custom optimizations for adaptive precision training. We examine how dynamic precision adjustments can optimize performance across different GPU architectures (A100 and V100) and computational workloads.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on training a unified transformer model that processes text, image, and graph data simultaneously while dynamically adjusting numerical precision to optimize for different hardware capabilities and data modalities.

### Key Features

- **Adaptive Precision Training**: Dynamic adjustment of precision based on model component requirements and GPU architecture capabilities
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Unified transformer architecture for text, image, and graph data
- **Cross-Architecture Optimization**: Performance benchmarking and optimization for both A100 and V100 GPUs
- **DeepSpeed Integration**: Leveraging DeepSpeed's distributed training capabilities with custom optimizations

## Performance Metrics

We evaluate our implementation across multiple dimensions:

- Training throughput (samples/second)
- Convergence behavior
- Memory efficiency
- Precision-specific performance characteristics
